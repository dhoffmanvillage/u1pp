# Unit 1 Programming Project

For this project, you will be solving three different problems using Java. Make sure to read the instructions carefully and complete the whole project. Use the **Sample Run** as a guide.

## PART A

For **Part A** you are going to do some basic variable creation and printing.
Complete the method `partA()`:

1. Find the comment `//YOUR CODE FOR PART A HERE`
2. Delete the comment
3. Create three variables
   - A whole number
   - A floating-point number
   - A true/false value
4. Set the whole number to the value `14001`
5. Set the floating-point number to `0.0456`
6. Set the true/false varaible to `false`
7. Print all three variables on the same line, with a space between them, then move the print cursor to the next line

## PART B

For **PART B**, you are going to help someone with their math homework. You will create a method that will solve some basic formulas about circles and spheres, given a radius.
Complete the method `partB()`:

1. Find the comment `//YOUR CODE FOR PART B HERE`
2. Delete the comment
3. Set the `final` variable `PI` to `3.1419`
4. Calculate and print the circumference of a circle with a radius represented by the variable `radius`
5. On a new line, calculate and print the area of the circle with a radius represented by the variable `radius`
6. Finally, on a new line, calculate and print the volume of the sphere with a radius represented by the variable `radius`. Move the print cursor to the next line

## PART C

For **PART C**, you will be creating a tip calculator for someone dining at a restaurant who doesn't want to do mental math.
Complete the method `partC()`:

1. Find the comment `//YOUR CODE FOR PART C HERE`
2. Delete the comment
3. Use the variables `billTotal` and `tipPercent` provided
   - `billTotal` represents the total cost of a meal and is a positive `double`
   - `tipPercent` represents the percentage the customer wants to tip the server. It is represented as an `double` between 0.0 - 100.0
4. Calculate and print the amount the customer should leave as a tip. Round to the nearest whole number.

## Sample Run

14001 0.0456 false
Enter a radius: 10
62.838
314.19
4189.2
Enter a bill total: 80.25
Enter a tip percent: 21
17
